#  Fake NewsðŸ“° Classification 
## Introduction
I have made a Fake News Classification project using Machine Learning. I have created a flask web app, which will take the news as input and give the result about news is fake or real.
What things were used in this project.
- PassiveAggresive algorithm for classification.
- TFIDFVectorizer for handling the news data
- Flask for handling the backend of the web app
- Simple HTML+CSS for the frontend of the site.
